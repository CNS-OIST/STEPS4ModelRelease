# CaBurstFull: validations

In this model we compare STEPS 3 and STEPS 4 solutions. It is suggested to run this model on a cluster. In this folder we provide some example scripts adated to run on the bb5 cluster and locally. 

Notice that STEPS 3 requires the full mesh for all the working modes. Conversely, STEPS 4 receives the folder where the previously split mesh resides. Check the README on the mesh folder to find out more about how to correctly split the mesh
